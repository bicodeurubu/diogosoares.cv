        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I attended my first RD Summit by RD Station with <strong class="text-text">Hubify - Performance Digital Marketing</strong> and Marcão Andrade. Besides the unforgettable moments with the team (and this relaxed moment participating as a judge in one of the most fun activations of the entire event), I managed to catch some clues about the current state of conversational.
        </p>

        {/* Key Insight Box */}
        <div class="p-6 bg-accent/5 rounded-xl border border-accent/20 my-8">
          <p class="text-text font-medium text-lg mb-0">
            When you have a clear purpose, you've already covered more than half the journey. I say this about brands, products, events, and businesses.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This came to mind because I've been to many Product and Agile events, and at the Summit it's clear that <strong class="text-text">the commitment is to change</strong> and it's the commitment that changes things. Not a tool or methodology. These should serve what you aspire to, not the other way around. Change is about culture, mindset, and especially education.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-display text-text mt-12 mb-6">The Conversational Gap</h2>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In this sense, there seems to be a <strong class="text-accent">huge gap</strong> between the maturity of conversational tools/methodologies and what people with purpose for change have been dreaming about conversational. Almost two separate worlds.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I'm old enough to have lived through the website boom in the early 2000s in Brazil, and we didn't experience such distortion of perception back then between what a tool does and the dream it effectively delivers.
        </p>

        <div class="p-6 bg-surface-elevated rounded-xl border border-border my-8">
          <p class="text-text leading-relaxed mb-0">
            <strong>Don't confuse this with a general failure!</strong> Quite the opposite. We have absolutely fantastic cases, masterful applications, and we have an absolutely devoted audience in Brazil. There is data and volume that uncontroversially show the power of a business using channels like WhatsApp.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          What I'm saying is that <strong class="text-text">conversational is not "next next finish"</strong>. Conversational is your brand, your business, being there with purpose.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-display text-text mt-12 mb-6">The Platform Problem</h2>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The truth is that platforms are still very immature, varying between:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-text-secondary">
          <li>Extremely simple and incapable of basic customizations</li>
          <li>Absolutely complex and ungovernable for no reason, with an endless number of configurations to be monitored daily and absurd rules that in practice prevent simple funnel analyses</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          What does this mean? <strong class="text-text">There are many frustrated people</strong>, many people thinking about cyclically switching platforms.
        </p>

        <div class="p-6 bg-accent/5 rounded-xl border border-accent/20 my-8">
          <p class="text-text font-medium mb-0">
            What's the problem with all this? In my opinion, it's worth going back to the initial point: <strong>does your brand have a conversational purpose?</strong> Or does it think of WhatsApp just to "send SMS" or "fill out forms" because the user likes the channel?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-display text-text mt-12 mb-6">The Art of Conversational</h2>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Adopting a conversational strategy and putting your brand's purpose in a short message with meaning for the customer is an <strong class="text-accent">art that demands care</strong>. It should be a continuous pursuit of serving your customer at the best points of the journey.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Your customer doesn't think about calling you on WhatsApp only when they received a promotion. <strong class="text-text">Most of the time your customer doesn't want to buy anything from you</strong>, but wants to maintain a relationship with your business, perennial, when they need it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Those who found this balance by finding the business's place in conversational KNOW that the perfect platform doesn't exist, but that despite them, it makes sense to stay there. It requires daily effort, constant learning, and lots of willingness to deal with new ideas every day.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-display text-text mt-12 mb-6">What I Learned from RD Summit</h2>

        <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
          And that's what I learned from RD Summit and its purpose. If the conversational market is still immature, if its platforms are still far below the processes your customers really need:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-text-secondary">
          <li><strong class="text-text">Focus on education and training</strong>, don't force sales with low maturity</li>
          <li>Help the entire base mature with you</li>
          <li>Show that there are difficulties, that we will work hard together</li>
          <li>The result for those who stand firm and understand their purpose there is something extraordinary</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Key Takeaway */}
        <div class="p-8 bg-surface-elevated rounded-2xl border border-border my-10">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-display text-text mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Brazilian audience is great at recognizing and validating good conversational experiences; we are a reference in this. The worst thing that could happen to your brand is wanting to close your eyes to this.
          </p>
          <p class="text-accent font-medium text-lg mb-0">
            Build a legitimate effort in conversational and you will be rewarded — it takes time and focused learning, but it's worth it. Very worth it.
          </p>
