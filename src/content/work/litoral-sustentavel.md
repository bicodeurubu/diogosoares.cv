## The Context
A complex multi-stakeholder project involving 13 municipalities, aiming to create a sustainable development plan for the coastline.

## The Role
As Project Manager, I facilitated dialogue between conflicting interests (real estate development vs. environmental preservation).
- **Consensus Building:** Organized over 50 public hearings and workshops.
- **Technical coordination:** Managed a team of 20+ specialized consultants (geographers, biologists, sociologists).

## Legacy
The project resulted in a codified Regional Action Plan that is still used today as a guideline for public policy in the region.
