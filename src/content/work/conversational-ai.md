## The Challenge
To scale intelligent contact platforms for major enterprise clients, ensuring that automated conversations feel human, helpful, and context-aware.

## The Approach
We utilized a data-driven approach, analyzing thousands of conversation flows to identify bottlenecks and user drop-off points. By applying **anthropological concepts of linguistic reciprocity**, we redesigned the bot personas to be more empathetic and responsive.

### Key Outcomes
- **30% Increase** in user retention during automated flows.
- **2x Improvement** in CSAT scores for automated support.
- Successful integration with complex legacy CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot).

## Technical Context
The solution involved orchestrating multiple APIs and ensuring low-latency responses. We focused on a modular architecture that allowed for rapid A/B testing of conversation scripts.
