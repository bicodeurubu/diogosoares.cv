## The Challenge
Bridging the gap between Marketing and Sales departments, which were operating in silos with disjointed data.

## The Solution
A unified Customer Data Platform (CDP) approach.
- **Unified Lifecycle:** Defined clear stages from "Lead" to "Evangelist".
- **Automated Hand-offs:** Triggers that notify sales teams exactly when a lead shows buying intent signals.

## Results
- **15% Increase** in Lead-to-Deal conversion rate.
- **Data Integrity:** Eliminated duplicate records and defined a single source of truth for customer data.
